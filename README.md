# Simple Projects

This is me making some simple JavaScript applications. I am doing this to practice the use of JSDoc and localstorage.

## To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list application. You can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

You may add further details to each task by clicking on the task itself.

Localstorage is used to store the tasks.
