# Simple Projects

This is me making some simple CRUD-y JavaScript applications. I am doing this to practice the use of JSDoc and localstorage.

## Projects

- [x] To-Do List
- [x] Expense Tracker
- [ ] Notes App
- [x] Vowel Counter

## To-Do List

This is a basic to-do list application. You can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

You may add further details to each task by clicking on the task itself.

Localstorage is used to store the tasks.

## Expense Tracker

This is a basic expense tracker application. You can add, remove, and edit expenses.

You may add further details or modify to each expense by clicking on the expense itself.

Localstorage is used to store the expenses.

(Work in progress)

## Vowel Counter

This is a basic vowel counter application. You can input a string and it will count the number of vowels in the string.

It does this automatically as you type.
