# Simple Projects

This is me making some simple CRUD-y JavaScript applications. I am doing this to practice the use of JSDoc and localstorage.

## Projects

- [x] To-Do List
- [x] Expense Tracker
- [ ] Notes App
- [x] Vowel Counter

## To-Do List

This is a basic to-do list application. You can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

You may add further details to each task by clicking on the task itself.

Localstorage is used to store the tasks.
